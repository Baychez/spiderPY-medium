# Medium Spider
## Searches medium for links to add to lists based on link type.
#### root starts on home page 

#### Run: ```python spider.py``` for basic use, or add a third argument as a number ```python spider.py int(x)```: it will iterate through all the NEW medium links (only on site urls not off page ones) and grab the links off those pages as well, adding them to the links to be combed through x number of times.
