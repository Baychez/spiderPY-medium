#### A Python Webcrawler

Feel free to use it and change it how you like - All my spider projects are under MIT licenses.

### Project Description:
Python Web Crawler that crawls https://meduim.com and grabs all the urls. It will also loop through those urls for the urls on those pages as well up to the number of specified times in the command line. It saves those links in four differnt files depending on the link type: links (for all links), stories (for all the stories links), offSite (for all the links that go offSite), mediumLinks (for all links that are stay on the medium site)

### How To Run:
``` python spider.py ```
or with an argument 
``` python spider.py numOfLoopTimes```
